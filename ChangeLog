2025-XX-XX v1.6.3 (so 8.0.6)  Dave Flater

  Jean-Pierre Demailly passed away in 2022.  Dave Flater has taken over
  maintenance of libXaw3dXft.  https://github.com/DaveFlater/libXaw3dXft
  replaces the abandoned
  https://sourceforge.net/projects/sf-xpaint/files/libxaw3dxft/.

  Fixed GCC 14 FTB (incompatible pointer type) in XawIm.c.
  Fixed vertical spacing in List when FreeType is used.
  Fixed wrong highlighting width in List when FreeType is used.
  Fixed description in libxaw3dxft.pc.in (was from libXaw3d).
  Fixed omission of Xaw3dXftP.h from xaw3dinclude_HEADERS in Makefile.am.
  Added example Xresources (was Xdefault) and old READMEs to installed docs.

  Began using normal Semantic Versioning.  libXaw3dXft version numbers no
  longer have anything to do with libXaw3d releases and no longer have a
  letter suffix.

  Spring cleaning:
  Removed generated files and the empty .deps directory.
  Removed files pertaining to Imake and Debian.
  Merged three Makefile.am files (recursive make considered harmful).
  Cleaned up Makefile.am and configure.ac.
  Made ChangeLog, AUTHORS, NEWS, and README as needed for compliance.

  libXaw3d changes merged:
  2013-06-06 2c16f322 Fix --disable-feature options in configure
  2014-06-05 15ffa3af configure: Drop AM_MAINTAINER_MODE

  2023-03-04 dbf8869b configure: Use LT_INIT from libtool 2 instead of deprecated AC_PROG_LIBTOOL
  2024-02-17 79134895 Remove unused sharedlib.c

2020-07-02, v1.6.2h (so 8.0.5)  Jean-Pierre Demailly

	* TextAction.c: further small enhancements to the edition routines,
	  in such a way that  _Xaw3dXft->edit_delete_alternative = 2
	  corresponds to the default behavior of modern text widgets.

2020-06-30, v1.6.2g  Jean-Pierre Demailly

	* Text.c: the new parameter _Xaw3dXft->text_sb_right (set to 1)
	  allows text widget scrollbars to be put on the right edge
	  of windows.

2020-06-16, v1.6.2f  Jean-Pierre Demailly

	* TextAction.c: two functions added, namely
	    DeleteBackwardCharOnly(), KillCurrentSelectionOrBackwardChar()
	  while DeleteBackwardChar() was modified, and corresponding
	  bindings
	    delete-previous-char-only,  kill-selection-or-char
	  introduced for app-defaults callbacks, so as to accommodate
	  modern editing behavior: BackSpace and Delete keys can now
	  optionally kill the text selection if it is non empty, and
	  otherwise they kill the character backward.
	  This behavior is not enabled by default, but becomes active
	  by setting  _Xaw3dXft->edit_delete_alternative = 1;

2016-12-10, v1.6.2e  Jean-Pierre Demailly

	* 3 line addition in Command.c that circumvents what seems to be
	  a bug of certain X11/Xorg drivers, e.g. the intel driver,
	  version 2.99.917. No other significant change.

2015-01-02, v1.6.2d  Jean-Pierre Demailly

	* Minor API change, functionality identical. The main goal of the
	  change is to make libXaw3dxft source and binary compatible with
	  the newer libXaw3d-1.6.2 library.

2014-03-03, v1.6.2c  Jean-Pierre Demailly

	* A fix has been included, that allows to correctly highlight text
          strings in AsciiText widgets, and also allows making Lists
	  with special colors for directories.

2012-03-04, v1.6.2  Jean-Pierre Demailly

This is a newer version which should be entirely source compatible with the
current development versions of libXaw3d-1.6.2 and provides additionally
support for freetype and UTF8 encoding (as did earlier versions
of libxaw3dxft <= 1.3.3).

2012-01-31, v1.3.3 (so 7.0.2)  Jean-Pierre Demailly

	Changed the font resource mechanism in AsciiSink.c, Label.c, List.c,
	SmeBSB.c, and Tip.c. The new resource is stored as a String in the
	'fontname' field, and converted as an XftFont * is the new private
	'font' field. New definition strings XtNxftFont and XtCXftFont are
	provided so that no odd interaction can occur with the old font
	mechanism.

2012-01-27, v1.3.2 (so 7.0.1)  David Flater

	Fixed strangely broken rendering when Xaw3dXftEncoding == 8.  In
	Text.c, _XawDrawString, the invocation of XftTextExtents8 before
	XClearArea was using len/2 when it should have been just len
	(copy-paste from the 16-bit code).

	Unbroke the font resources in AsciiSink.c, Label.c, List.c,
	SmeBSB.c, and Tip.c.  Updated comments in header files to indicate
	that the default is Xaw3dXftDefaultFont not XtDefaultFont.

	Added extern "C" language to Xaw3dXft.h, where long identifiers
	run afoul of C++ mangling.

	Moved the version defines from the "private" Xaw3dP.h header to
	Xaw3dXft.h.

	Added the phony X11 directory to what is removed by 'make clean'.

	For consistency with Xaw and Xaw3d, added Template.c, Template.h,
	and TemplateP.h to include_HEADERS.

	Added a configure check to locate the freetype2 headers and modify
	AM_CPPFLAGS only if necessary.

	Misfeature noted but not fixed:  Post-fork Xaw has a much better
	solution to the problem that was addressed by the "SimpleMenu
	widget now supports scrolling through entries too numerous to fit
	on the screen" change that traces to Xaw3d 1.5A:  Xaw now does
	multi-column menus automatically.

2012-01-02, v1.3.1 (so 7.0.0)  David Flater

	Repackaged:
	  Extracted source from xpaint-2.9.8.3.tar.bz2.
	  Automake'd the build process.  It passes make distcheck.
	  Assigned version number 1.3.1.
	  Bumped c:r:a to 7:0:0 (RPMs were doing libXaw3dxft.so.6.1).
          Renamed README.XAW3DXFT to README, created ChangeLog and other
	  files for GNU compliance.
	  Added version #defines to Xaw3dP.h.

	The substitutions on Xaw3dP.h are now done by configure;
	consequently, the input file is Xaw3dP.h.in instead of
	Xaw3dP.h.sed.

	The following configure options replace Imakefile edits:

	--enable-multiplane-pixmaps
                          enable color pixmaps and add dependency on libXpm
                          (default disabled)
	--enable-gray-blkwht-stipples
                          enable grayed stipple shadows (default enabled)
        --enable-arrow-scrollbars
                          enable scrollbars with arrows (default enabled)
