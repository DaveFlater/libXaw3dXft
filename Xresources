! Example Xresources content for the Xaw3d widget set

! To obtain an appearance similar to another well-known widget set, use the 
! following resources:
*background:        LightSkyBlue
*shapeStyle:        Rectangle
*beNiceToColormap:  False

! By default, Label widgets do not have shadows drawn for them.  You can
! force shadows to be drawn by specifying:
*Label*shadowWidth: 2

! If you'd like the default behavior (i.e. not 3-D) on pulldown menus, use:
! (uncomment next line:)
!*SmeBSB*shadowWidth: 0
